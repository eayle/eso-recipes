    <p>Elsweyr is known for the production and trade of an illegal substance called Moon Sugar. Moon Sugar is a sweet and addictive narcotic derived from the moon plant, and it is the primary ingredient used to create the highly illegal drug known as Skooma. The Khajiit, the cat-like inhabitants of Elsweyr, are often associated with the production and distribution of these illegal substances, making them a central part of the region's criminal activities.</p>
